# AI-Powered Traffic Management System
This project is an AI-driven traffic management system that uses real-time vehicle detection to optimize traffic flow at a four-way intersection. It combines computer vision for vehicle counting with a dynamic traffic simulation to adjust signal timings based on traffic density. An optional hardware component allows the system to control physical traffic light LEDs using an Arduino. FeaturesReal-time Vehicle Detection: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model via the Darkflow framework to identify and count vehicles in images of an intersection.Dynamic Traffic Simulation: A Pygame-based simulation of a four-way intersection where traffic signal timings are dynamically adjusted based on the detected number of vehicles.Intelligent Signal Control: The system calculates green signal durations proportionally to the traffic density in each lane, minimizing congestion and wait times.Hardware Integration (Optional): Includes an Arduino sketch to control a physical model of the traffic light system via serial communication.Modular and Extensible: The codebase has been refactored into a modular, object-oriented structure, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.üèõÔ∏è System ArchitectureThe system operates in two main stages:Vehicle Detection:The vehicle_detector.py script takes an image of the intersection as input.It uses a pre-trained YOLO model to detect vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles).It outputs the number of detected vehicles for each of the four lanes (right, left, up, down).Traffic Simulation & Control:The main.py script launches the Pygame simulation.It calls the vehicle detection script to get the current traffic density.The TrafficManager class uses this data to calculate the optimal green light duration for each lane.The simulation visually represents the traffic flow, with vehicles moving according to the smart traffic signals.If an Arduino is connected, the system sends commands via a serial port to update the physical LEDs.üîß Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.7+Git(Optional) Arduino IDE for the hardware component.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone https://github.com/aaronseq12/AITrafficManagementSystem.git
cd AITrafficManagementSystem

2. Set up a Python Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesThe project uses several Python libraries. The darkflow library requires manual setup.First, install the libraries from requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt
Next, build the Cython components for darkflow:cd darkflow
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ..
This command compiles the necessary Cython extensions within the darkflow directory.4. Download YOLOv2 WeightsThe vehicle detection model requires pre-trained weights. Download the yolov2.weights file and place it in a bin directory inside the root of the project.Create the bin directory:mkdir bin
Download the weights file from the official YOLO website (or a mirror): yolov2.weightsMove the downloaded yolov2.weights file into the bin/ directory.5. (Optional) Arduino SetupIf you want to use the physical traffic light model:Connect your Arduino to your computer.Open Traffic_signal/Traffic_signal.ino in the Arduino IDE.Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.Make sure to note the COM port your Arduino is connected to (e.g., COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux). You will need to update this in the config.py file.üöÄ UsageThe project can be run in two modes: simulation-only or with vehicle detection.Running the Full System (Detection + Simulation)To run the complete system, where vehicle detection determines the signal timings:python main.py --use-detection --image-path test_images/1.jpg
--use-detection: This flag tells the system to run the vehicle detector.--image-path: Specify the path to the intersection image you want to analyze. You can use any of the images in the test_images folder.The system will first process the image, print the detected vehicle counts, and then launch the simulation with timings adjusted for that traffic scenario.Running the Simulation StandaloneTo run the simulation with default, fixed signal timings (without running the vehicle detector):python main.py
